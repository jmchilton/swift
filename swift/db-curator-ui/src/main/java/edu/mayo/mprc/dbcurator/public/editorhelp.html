<h1>Curation Editor</h1>

<br>


<h2>Mayo Clinic Proteomics Resource Center (MPRC)</h2>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose</span>: &nbsp;This application is used to create FASTA databases by
performing a number of steps. &nbsp;These steps will either add,
remove, or modify sequences. &nbsp;Steps will happen in order so that
if you add a sequence in a previous step it may be removed or modified
by a subsequent step.<br>

<br>
Use:<br>
<ul>
	<li>There are a number of things that should be included in all curations. &nbsp;These include:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ID</span>: &nbsp;this is a
			read only field that shows the id of the curaiton that is displayed.
			&nbsp;A curation acquires and ID after it is saved. &nbsp;This ID can
			later be used to retrieve the curation.
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unique Name</span>: &nbsp;A unique name that must not be longer than 21
			characters and cannot contain spaces
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Curation Title:</span> &nbsp;A fairly brief description of the curation
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owners Email:</span> &nbsp;the email of the person who should be notified
			with regards to this curation such as when it gets refreshed (see below)
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next automatic refresh date:</span> &nbsp;the date that the curation should
			next be automatically re-run (see below) (Optional).
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-run expiration date:</span> &nbsp;when should the curation should not be
			re-run after re-run (Optional).
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">How often to re-run:</span> the frequency that a re-run should be performed
		</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any notes to make:</span> &nbsp;A place to put more detailed information
			about the curation
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Progress report</span>: &nbsp;this box is used to display any messages to the
		user as well as show the progress of an executing curaiton.
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Curation</span>: clicking this will prompt the user for different option
		to load a curation
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>enter an id of an existing curation to load</li>
		<li>create a new curation with no set properties</li>
		<li>create an editable copy of the curation that is currently open.
			&nbsp;If this is done then a shortname then the unique name will not be
			set and needs to be re entered.
		</li>
		<li>cancel - just leave the current curation open</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save:</span> clicking this will
		save the curation so it can be accessed later. &nbsp;The ID for the
		curation will then be displayed. &nbsp;Note that a curation cannot be
		saved after it has been run
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test:</span> (not yet
		implemented) performs a complete run of the curation but leaves no
		trace of the run meaning that no files are retained and the curation is
		not saved
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run:</span> &nbsp;performs the
		curation and generates the resulting .fasta file and then saves the
		curation when it is complete. &nbsp;Not that editing of a curation
		after running is not permitted.
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose a step to add:</span>
		&nbsp;this list gives the steps that can be added to the curation.
		&nbsp;Steps will be added at the end (bottom) of the curation and then
		you can move them to where you would like them in the process.
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Steps to run:</span> &nbsp;this
		area show the steps that are currently part of the curation. &nbsp;You
		can move them up and down or remove them from the curation using the
		respective buttons.
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path to completed curation file:</span> &nbsp;this text box can be copied and
		after the curation is run the path to the file will be located
	</li>
</ul>
Step Types (more steps will be added upon user request):<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		New FASTA database from FTP&nbsp;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>specify a ftp address for accessing a FASTA database over anonymous ftp</li>
		<li>you can alternatively select from a list of commonly requested databases (if you have one you use a lot let
			us know).
		</li>
		<li>if you want to always use the most up-to-date version then
			check the "Always check for newest release" box otherwise any re-runs
			of the curation will just use the same fasta file if it can.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>FASTA header filter - filter the database based on either simple text or regular expression criteria</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This step allows you to enter some words to search for in the
			header of each FASTA sequence. &nbsp;The "Simple Text" setting will
			just take a space delimitted set of words and to see if they exist in
			the sequence. &nbsp;You must specify an option
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>"Any" - meaning that if the header contains any of the given words then you should include that
				sequence
			</li>
			<li>"All" - meaning all of the words given must be in the header</li>
			<li>"None" - meaning that none of the words given can appear in the header</li>
		</ul>
		<li>This step also allows you to enter a regular expression that
			you want to match in the header. &nbsp;The "All" and "Any" setting work
			identically in this case and if you want to specify multiple regular
			expressions then you should add another step to do this. &nbsp;The
			"None" setting will invert the results meaning that you don't want to
			match the given regular expression.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Sequence randomization - take the sequences and either reverse or scramble them in order to perform some
		statistical
		tricks
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This performs an operation on the sequences to provide a nonsense sequence.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sequence Reversal - takes each sequence and reverses it. &nbsp;Each header is appended with &lt;REVERSED&gt;.</li>
			<li>Sequence Scamble - takes each monomer in the sequence and
				randomly moves it to a new location. &nbsp;Each header is appended with
				&lt;SCRAMBLED&gt;</li>
			<li>You can choose to retain the original sequences as well in
				which case both the original and manipulated sequences will be included.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Add a manual sequence - Enter a header and a sequence of your own
		to the final database. &nbsp;Anything in the "Header" will be appended
		with a '&gt;' character if one is not already there. &nbsp;If you do
		not enter a header then the first line in the sequence must be the
		header (with '&gt;') which will be automatically detected and moved to
		the header location.
	</li>
</ul>
