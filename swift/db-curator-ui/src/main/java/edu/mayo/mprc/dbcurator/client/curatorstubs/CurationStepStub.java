 * A CurationStepStub is an object that contains the information pertinent to displaying a CurationStep and can be passed
 * between Client and Server using GWT-RPC.  We use the getID for synchronizing the step with an existing step but if ID
 * is null then we have a new step and if a curation was sent out with a step with a given id and comes back without that step
 * then we need to remove that object on the server side.<br>
 * Messaging is currently global to a step.  Any errors will need to be shown by the step as a whole.  If we decide it is
 * worth it we can change modify it to localize the error messages somehow.
