/**
 * A service is a named entity that allows requests to be sent, delivered, executed and
 * responses returned back. There are two users of a service - those who send requests, and those who receive them and send
 * back responses.
 * <p/>
 * How exactly are the requests sent and queued is dependent on implementation - JMS, GridEngine, sockets or other technologies can be used.
 * A service can be one-to-one, one-to-many, load balanced, etc. You create services through
 * central service factory {@link ServiceFactory}. Which service you obtain is specified by the URI.
 * <p/>
 * The Service allows multi-threaded access. You can share one service and send requests from multiple threads,
 * or you can receive requests from multiple threads. Internally, the service might create thread-local variables
 * to cope with such usage patterns in case the underlying technology is not multi-treaded.
 * <p/>
 * See {@link ServiceFactory}.
