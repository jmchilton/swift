Mayo Proteomics Core Services
=============================

Services are configurable modules that provide functionality,
e.g. running an X!Tandem search. 

The implementation is currently not based
on web services, instead we rely on a daemon project at https://github.com/romanzenka/lib/tree/master/daemon that uses JMS for sending messages about progress.
A web service wrapper might be an interesting addition.
